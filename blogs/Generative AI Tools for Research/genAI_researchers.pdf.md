Ever wondered which generative AI tool to use for your research tasks, such as searching, summarizing, and reviewing scientific literature? What criteria should you employ to select the one that best fits your needs? Which tool addresses the concerns that matter to you? Additionally, what are the monthly subscription costs for individuals if you choose to subscribe to the paid version of your tool of interest?

In this blog, I will delve into four prominent GenAI tools that utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): **Elicit**, **Consensus**, **SciSpace**, and **Perplexity**. We'll explore their features, the databases they employ, and the key differences that set them apart.

### **Introduction**

Using AI tools like GenAI in our daily tasks these days is inevitable. However, this also raises concerns regarding the accuracy and reliability of their outputs. GenAI tools can produce outputs that are plausible yet factually incorrect or misleading- a phenomenon knows as "**Hallucination**". To address this issue, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which combines large language models with external knowledge bases to generate more accurate and context-aware responses has been integrated.


### **GenAI Tools for Researchers**

### **1. Elicit**

"Elicit is an AI research assistant. It uses generative AI and language models to automate research tasks. Currently, Elicit focused on **finding and analyzing academic papers**".

**Features:**

-   **Research Assistance:** Elicit acts as an AI research assistant, helping users find relevant academic papers based on queries.
-   **Literature Review Automation:** It streamlines the literature review process by summarizing findings and extracting key information from papers.

**Database Used:**

-   **Semantic Scholar Corpus:** Elicit leverages the **Semantic Scholar** database, which comprises over 200 million academic papers across various disciplines. [Elicit's Source for Papers](https://support.elicit.com/en/articles/553025)

### **2. Consensus**

"Consensus searches through a corpus of 200M research papers and cover all types of scientific research everything from Astronomy, to Neuroscience, Statistics, Data Science, Archaeology, Nutrition, Electrical Engineering, and much more".

**Features:**

-   **AI-Powered Search Engine:** Consensus allows users to query scientific literature and get aggregated answers.
-   **Evidence Summarization:** It summarizes findings from multiple papers to present consensus or differing viewpoints.
-   **Claim Verification:** Users can verify scientific claims by checking the supporting evidence from peer-reviewed articles.

**Database Used:**

-   **Peer-Reviewed Journals:** Consensus primarily taps into databases containing peer-reviewed scientific literature to ensure credible sources (**Semantic Scholar**). [What Does Consensus Search Over](https://consensus.app/home/blog/welcome-to-consensus/#:~:text=The%20current%20source%20material%20used,across%20all%20domains%20of%20science.)

### **3. SciSpace**

**Features:**

-   **AI Co-Pilot for Papers:** SciSpace assists in understanding and interpreting scientific papers.
-   **Explanation of Complex Terms:** It can explain jargon, mathematical equations, and complex concepts within papers.
-   **Document Navigation:** Offers features like summarization, annotation, and cross-referencing within documents.

**Database Used:**

-   **Extensive Academic Repository:** SciSpace accesses a wide range of academic papers and publications, though specific database partnerships are less publicly detailed.

### **4. Perplexity**

"Perplexity is an AI powered search engine designed to revolutionize the way you discover information. Ask any question, and it searches the internet to give you an accessible, conversational, and verifiable answer. Think of Perplexity as a research partner, always on the clock, saving you valuable time by providing the precise knowledge you need".

**Features:**

-   **Answer Engine:** Perplexity provides direct answers to user queries using AI and internet resources.
-   **Source Attribution:** It cites sources, allowing users to verify information.
-   **Real-Time Information:** Accesses up-to-date information, making it suitable for current events and recent data.

**Database Used:**

-   **Internet and Indexed Websites:** Perplexity crawls the web gathering information from authoritative sources like articles, websites, and journals.

### **Comparative Analysis**

**Commonalities:**

-   **Utilization of RAG:** All four tools enhance their generative AI capabilities by retrieving relevant information from external databases.
-   **AI-Driven Summarization:** They provide concise summaries of complex information, aiding in quick comprehension.

**Key Differences:**

-   **Target Audience:**
    -   *Elicit* and *Consensus* are geared towards researchers and academics.
    -   *SciSpace* caters to both professionals and learners needing assistance with specific documents.
    -   *Perplexity* targets a general audience seeking information on various topics.
-   **Database Scope:**
    -   *Elicit* and *Consensus* focus on academic and peer-reviewed literature.
    -   *SciSpace* provides in-depth analysis within documents.
    -   *Perplexity* utilizes broader internet resources.
-   **Feature Set:**
    -   *Elicit* excels in literature review automation.
    -   *Consensus* emphasizes evidence quality and aggregated viewpoints.
    -   *SciSpace* offers in-document explanations and educational support.
    -   *Perplexity* provides real-time answers with source attribution across diverse topics.

### **Recommendations and Limitations of GenAI Tools**

1.  **Risk of Misinformation (Hallucinations)**: Generative AI tools can sometimes produce incorrect or fabricated information, which may be difficult to verify, especially within specialized scientific fields.
2.  **Reproducibility Concerns**: Due to stochastic processes inherent in the models, identical inputs do not always yield consistent outputs.
3.  **Prompt Sensitivity**: The quality of the generated outputs is highly dependent on the structure of the prompts; minor changes in phrasing can lead to significantly different or inaccurate results.
4.  **Bias Toward Generalizations**: Generative AI models may oversimplify complex scientific concepts, limiting the depth and nuance of analyses.
5.  **Quality and Accessibility**: Paid versions of commercial generative AI tools often provide more accurate and detailed results compared to their free versions.
6.  **Ethical and Privacy Considerations**: The use of generative AI on proprietary or sensitive information must account for data privacy, copyright laws, and ethical usage guidelines.

### **Conclusion**

The integration of RAG in GenAI tools like Elicit, Consensus, SciSpace, and Perplexity marks a significant stride in information accessibility and comprehension. Each tool brings unique features tailored to different user needs—from academic research assistance to general knowledge queries. Understanding their functionalities and databases can help users select the most appropriate tool for their specific requirements.
