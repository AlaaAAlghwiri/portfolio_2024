### Energy

- Develop ML models to optimize energy consumption, predict equipment failures, and forecast demand and supply.

- Apply deep reinforcement learning for scheduling, energy management, and adaptive HVAC systems.

- Advance renewable energy integration using data-driven methods.

- Leverage big data analytics to improve the efficiency and sustainability of energy systems.

### Healthcare

- Predictive Modeling for Chronic Conditions: Build and validate models to anticipate disease progression and adverse events.

- Personalized Care: Develop patient-level risk stratification and treatment recommendation frameworks.

- Transfer Learning: Adapt models across cohorts and institutions to improve accuracy and reduce data requirements.
