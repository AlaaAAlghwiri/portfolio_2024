## What is 

### Definition
Probability and Statistics are two branches of mathematics that deal with the analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. Probability theory is concerned with the likelihood of events occurring, while statistics focuses on the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data to make informed decisions.

### Significance
Probability and statistics are essential tools in various fields, including science, engineering, economics, finance, and social sciences. They help in making predictions, drawing conclusions, and testing hypotheses based on data.

### Applications in various fields
Probability and statistics are used in various fields, such as:
- Science: to analyze experimental data and make predictions.
- Engineering: to design experiments and analyze data.
- Economics: to analyze market trends and make informed decisions.
- Finance: to model risk and make investment decisions.
- Social sciences: to analyze survey data and draw conclusions.
- Healthcare: to analyze patient data and make treatment decisions.
- Machine learning: to build predictive models and analyze data.
- Quality control: to monitor and improve processes.
