    "section": "",
    "text": "Importance: Our study is the first large randomized controlled trial to evaluate a population health management (PHM) approach to implement chronic kidney disease (CKD) guideline recommendations and newer therapeutics in the primary care setting.\nObjective: To compare the effect of an electronic health record (EHR)-based, PHM intervention on guideline concordant CKD medication use and achievement of clinical process outcomes to usual primary care. To describe temporal trends in guideline recommended medications during the study period.\nDesign: Post-hoc analysis of Kidney Coordinated HeAlth Management Partnership (Kidney CHAMP), a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (5/2019 to 7/2022).\nSetting: Structured electronic health record data from a large academic health system representative of rural and urban communities in western Pennsylvania.\nParticipants: Adults (age 18-85 years) with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2, following with a University of Pittsburgh primary care provider (PCP), not seeing a nephrologist, and at high risk of CKD progression.\nIntervention: Kidney CHAMP (an EHR-based, PHM approach to provide guideline-informed individualized CKD management to PCPs) vs usual primary care.\nMain outcome and measures: Exposure days to guideline recommended medications (i.e., ACEi/ARB, moderate- or high-intensity statin, SGLT-2i, and GLP-1RA) at end of study. Process outcomes: hypertension control (blood pressure &lt;130/80 mmHg) and glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c ≤7%) at end of follow-up period, and annual albuminuria testing.\nResults: All 1596 enrolled Kidney CHAMP patients (mean age 74±9 years, 928 (58%) female, and 127 (8%) Black) from 98 PCP practices (754 patients from 48 intervention practices, and 842 patients from 50 usual care practices) were analyzed. At baseline, mean eGFR was 36 mL/min/1.73m2 and mean UACR was 410 mg/g. After a median 17-month follow-up period, exposure days per year to ACEi/ARB and moderate- or high-intensity statin were not different between arms There were significantly higher exposure days per year to SGLT-2i (56.6 days vs 32.4 days, relative benefit 1.75 [95% CI 1.15-2.34]) and GLP-1RA (77.9 days vs 29.3 days, relative benefit 2.66 [95% CI 1.59-3.73]) in intervention compared to usual care. However, there was no significant relative benefit (Kidney CHAMP vs usual care) in process outcomes: blood pressure &lt;130/80 mmHg (1.16 [95% CI 1.00-1.32]; 44.8% vs 39.0%), HbA1c &lt;7% (1.11 [95% CI 0.94-1.28]; 53.8% vs 51.4%, relative benefit), or annual UACR testing (1.14 [95% CI 0.97-1.30]; 50.6% vs 44.7%). The proportion of patients with an active medication order changed between 2019 to 2022 in the intervention and usual care arms, respectively, for ACEi/ARB [57.9% to 54.6%; and 56.9% to 50.3%], moderate- or high-intensity statin [64.1% to 66.1%; and 51.4% to 60.5%], SGLT-2i [6.5% to 27.5%; and 6.7% to 17.7%] and GLP1RA [3.1% to 28.3%; and 4.2% to 14.9%].\nConclusions and Relevance: Kidney CHAMP was an effective PHM approach to speed implementation of SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA for CKD in the primary care setting. But, therapeutic inertia may account for lack of difference in ACEi/ARB or statin use and other process measures."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background: Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on hemodialysis (HD) experience a high symptom burden which is compounded by unpredictable fluctuations in symptom severity. However, few studies have used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to determine how symptoms vary over time. This study aimed to characterize the diurnal and day-to-day variability in symptoms among HD patients.\nMethods: Patients enrolled in the Technology Assisted Collaborative Care (TĀCcare) trial rated the intensity of physical, cognitive, and mood symptoms using an automated telephone-administered version of the Daytime Insomnia Symptom Scale (DISS) at 4 time-points (morning, early afternoon, late afternoon, evening) for 7 consecutive days at baseline. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to verify the original 4-factor solution for the DISS: sleepiness/fatigue (SF), alert cognition (AC), positive mood (PM), and negative mood (NM). Symptom domain scores were calculated for each time point and mixed modeling with random patient effects was used to examine differences in daily symptoms daily time points between HD and non-HD days after controlling for age, gender, race, and comorbidities.\nResults: 160 patients were enrolled (mean age 57.6±13.8 years, 45% women, 52% White). Diurnal symptom variation existed; trends were non-linear and differed by HD vs. non-HD day. Day-to-day symptom variation also existed; patients endorsed better physical, cognitive, and mood states (i.e., higher AC and PM) as well as lower symptom burden (i.e., lower SF and NM) on non-HD days compared to HD days at all time-points. The greatest day-to-day mean differences (MDs) were observed in the early afternoon for all symptom domains: AC (MD=0.17 p&lt;0.001), PM (MD =0.28, p&lt;0.001), SF (MD =-0.66, p&lt;0.001), and NM (MD =-0.26, p&lt;0.001).\nConclusions: Patients with ESKD demonstrate diurnal variation in symptoms and greater symptom burden on HD days compared to non-HD days, with the most extreme differences in symptom severity occurring in the early afternoon."

    "text": "Background Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at risk of medication therapy problems (MTPs) due to high comorbidity and medication burden. Using data from the Kidney Coordinated HeAlth Management Partnership (K-CHAMP) trial, we used machine learning to identify predictors of MTPs in patients with CKD in the primary care setting.\nMethods We used data from patients enrolled in intervention arm of K-Champ trial which tested a population health management strategy, including medication management, for improving CKD care. The dataset was divided into 80% training and 20% testing subsets. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) served as the metric to assess the classifier’s efficacy in distinguishing between patients with and without MTP (Medication Therapy Problems). Initially, eight models were assessed, and the top three models, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting (GB), were selected. These three models underwent further refinement, and the best-performing model was chosen based on the highest AUROC using the testing set, while considering the Bias/Variance trade-off.\nResults: Among 730 patients who received medication review at baseline, 566 (77.5%) had at least 1 MTP at baseline. Their mean age 74, 55% females, 92% Whites, 64% with diabetes, 5.8 mean number of meds at baseline. AUROC for the 3 models are shown in Fig 1 for both the training and testing data sets. RF had best performance on the testing set with highest AUROC (0.72), a sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.64. The five most influential variables, ranked in descending order of importance for predicting individuals with MTP, were diabetes status (yes/no), A1C levels, UACR levels, age, and the count of comorbidities.\nConclusion: Random forest provided the highest performance in predicting MTP for patients with advanced CKD. Future work will focus on developing a user-friendly online tool aimed at identifying patients who may benefit most from pharmacist-led medication management."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background: Patients with ESKD have a high symptom burden and many report an acute exacerbation of symptoms immediately following hemodialysis (HD). While post-dialysis fatigue has been studied, very few studies have used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine post-HD symptom experiences.\nMethods: Participants in the Technology Assisted Collaborative Care (TĀCcare) trial completed an automated telephone-administered version of the Daytime Insomnia Symptom Scale (DISS) at 4 timepoints daily for 7 consecutive days. The DISS yields 4 symptom domain scores: Positive mood (PM), negative mood (NM), alert cognition (AC), and sleepiness/fatigue (SF). Post-HD symptom domain and item-level scores were compared to the corresponding timepoints on non-HD days via mixed models. Linear regression was used to examine the association of increased post-dialysis symptom burden with demographic, psychosocial, and disease-specific sample characteristics. All analyses adjusted for age, race, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index.\nResults: 160 HD patients were enrolled [mean age=58±14 years, 55% men, 52% White]. In the post-HD period, patients reported significantly lower PM [mean difference (MD)= -0.22, 95% CI (-0.29, -0.14), p&lt;0.001] and AC [MD= -0.13, 95% CI (-0.18, -0.08), p&lt;0.001] and significantly higher NM [MD=0.12, 95% CI (0.05, 0.19), p&lt;0.001] and SF [MD=0.51, 95% CI (0.42, 0.61), p&lt;0.001] symptoms, compared to non-HD days. There were no significant associations between post-dialysis symptom exacerbation and demographic, psychosocial, or disease-specific characteristics.\nConclusions: Patients with ESKD tend to experience worsening of both fatigue and mood symptoms after HD treatments. Our findings align with recent critiques that the post-dialysis fatigue label does not fully describe the post-HD symptom burden patients experience. Future studies should utilize EMA to assess a broader range of potential post-HD symptoms."

    "text": "Background: People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high-risk of experiencing medication therapy problems (MTPs) due to high comorbidity and medication burden. This study aims to characterize MTPs in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD who participated in the Kidney Coordinated HeAlth Management Partnership (K-CHAMP) trial, which tested a multidisciplinary population health management (PHM) intervention versus usual care on CKD evidence-based care delivery in the primary care setting.\nMethods: K-CHAMP enrolled 1,596 patients (754 intervention, 842 usual care control) from 101 cluster-randomized primary care practices. Patients were 18-85 years with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2, moderate-high risk of CKD progression, and not seeing a nephrologist. MTPs were identified through medication reviews completed by clinical pharmacists.\nResults: Medication reviews were completed for 730 (97%) intervention arm patients, with average age 74 ± 9 years and eGFR 37 ± 8 mL/min/1.73m2. Polypharmacy was evident in 63% of participants, who were prescribed an average of 6 medications. At baseline, 77.5% of patients experienced at least 1 MTP and medication discrepancies were observed in 79% of patients. The most common MTP was indication without drug, largely due to an indication for an SGLT-2 inhibitor. In patients with an MTP at baseline and at least one follow-up encounter, the cumulative rate of MTP resolution was 92% at 12-months.\nConclusion: MTPs and medication discrepancies are present in most patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD. Medication management through multidisciplinary team care can optimize medication therapy for patients with CKD."

    "text": "Background: Patient-reported symptoms are associated with inflammatory biomarkers in many chronic diseases. This secondary analysis of Technology Assisted stepped Collaborative Care (TĀCcare) trial data examined associations of inflammatory biomarkers with pain, fatigue, and depression in patients with ESKD and the effects of the TĀCcare intervention versus health education control on these biomarkers.\nMethods: Patients completed questionnaires and provided blood samples at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Interleukin (IL-)1RA, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and IL-6 were measured. IL-6/IL-10 ratios were calculated to examine T helper cells type 1 to type 2 (Th1/Th2) balance. Linear mixed-effects modeling was used to examine within- and between-group differences over the course of 3 and 6 months after adjusting for age, gender, race, and comorbidities.\nResults: Among the 160 patients (mean age 58±14, 55% men, 52% white), there were no significant associations between inflammatory biomarker levels and depression, pain, or fatigue at baseline. Both groups demonstrated significant reductions in anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-1RA) over the study period (p&lt;0.05). Compared to baseline, the treatment group had significant decreases in the inflammatory marker, TNF-α (p&lt;0.001) at 3-months, whereas the control group had a significant increase in the inflammatory marker IL-6/IL-10 ratio (p=0.02). Additionally, at 6-months the control group had a significant increase in IL-6/IL-10 ratio (β=0.75, p&lt;0.001) and decreases in IL-2 and TNF-α (p&lt;0.05). For the between-group analyses, the treatment group had significantly decreased IL-2 (β=-0.53, p&lt;0.001) compared to the control at 3 months. No other within- or between-group comparisons were significant.\nConclusions: There were no associations between biomarkers and patient-reported symptoms in a large ESKD cohort. As compared to control, TĀCcare intervention had a short term impact on reducing inflammatory burden. More studies are needed to determine if collaborative care interventions have the potential to attenuate inflammatory burden and immune imbalances in patients with ESKD."
