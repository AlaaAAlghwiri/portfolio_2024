## Abstract

**Background**: Gaps in guideline-concordant care for chronic kidney disease (CKD) lead to poor outcomes. The Kidney Coordinated HeAlth Management Partnership (K-CHAMP) cluster randomized trial tested the effect of a population health management intervention versus usual care on CKD progression and evidence-based care delivery in the primary care setting.

**Methods**: K-CHAMP included adults aged 18-85 years with eGFR \<60 mL/min/1.73m2 and moderate-high risk of CKD progression who were not seeing a nephrologist. The multi-faceted intervention included nephrology e-consult, pharmacist-led medication management, and patient education. In this post-hoc analysis, we evaluate the effectiveness of K-CHAMP on guideline-concordant care processes (blood pressure and glycemic control, annual albuminuria testing), and medication exposure days (ACEi/ARB, moderate-high intensity statin, SGLT-2i, GLP-1RA). Given multiplicity of outcomes, Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to control false discovery rate (FDR).

**Results**: All 1,596 (754 intervention, 842 usual care) enrolled patients (mean age 74±9 years, eGFR 37±8 mL/min/1.73m2, 928 (58%) female, 127 (8%) Black) were analyzed. After a median 17-month follow-up, intervention arm patients had significantly higher exposure days per year to SGLT-2i (56 vs 32 days, relative benefit 1.72, 95% CI 1.14-2.30) and GLP-1RA (78 vs 29 days, relative benefit 2.65, 95% CI 1.59-3.71) compared to usual care in adjusted analysis. At study initiation in 2019, similar proportion of patients were prescribed SGLT-2i and/or GLP-1RA in intervention and control arm (8% vs 6% respectively, rate ratio 1.23, 95% CI 0-2.99), but by 2022, prescription of these medications was significantly higher in intervention arm (44% vs 27% respectively, rate ratio 1.63, 95% CI 1.32-1.94). There was no significant difference in any process measures or exposure days to ACEi/ARB in patients with albuminuria or moderate-high intensity statin.

**Conclusions**: K-CHAMP was effective in accelerating implementation of SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA but did not increase ACEi/ARB in patients with albuminuria or moderate-high intensity statin use, or improve blood pressure control, glycemic control, or albuminuria testing in individuals with CKD in the primary care setting.
